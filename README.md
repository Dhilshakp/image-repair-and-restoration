# image-repair-and-restoration
A deep learning approach to image reconstruction and restoration using autoencoders

This project leverages deep learning to tackle image repair and restoration. It implements three advanced autoencoder architectures: Convolutional Autoencoder, Self-Attention Autoencoder, and Multi-Head Attention Autoencoder. Each model is designed to restore high-quality images from degraded ones. Evaluations using SSIM and PSNR metrics show that the Multi-Head Attention Autoencoder excels in image denoising and restoration, achieving the highest performance.
